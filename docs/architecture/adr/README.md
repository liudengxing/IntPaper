# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for InkPaper.

## 📖 What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documents an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

### Why Use ADRs?

- **Historical Context**: Understand why decisions were made
- **Team Alignment**: Keep everyone on the same page
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Help new team members understand the architecture
- **Decision Tracking**: Track the evolution of the architecture

## ✍️ Creating a New ADR

### 1. Use the Template

Copy the [template.md](template.md) to create a new ADR.

### 2. Naming Convention

```
NNN-title-with-dashes.md
```

Examples:
- `001-use-provider-for-state-management.md`
- `008-implement-offline-mode.md`

### 3. Fill Out All Sections

- **Title**: Short, descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue we're facing?
- **Decision**: What decision did we make?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?

### 4. Review and Discuss

- Open a pull request
- Get feedback from the team
- Update based on feedback
- Merge when consensus is reached
